# Patty - React Pattern Library Framework

Get started with your Styleguide with great tools at your hand, utilizing [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist), [react-styleguidist-visual](https://github.com/unindented/react-styleguidist-visual), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)!

Maintained with ‚ù§ by [Eric Zieger](https://github.com/thezieger) and [Sven Bischoff](https://github.com/medienlampe).

## Local development

- clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to spin up the local dev server

## Creating new components

- run `npm run create` (atm. only Linux/Mac)
- follow the instructions shown in the terminal

## Writing tests

### Code tests

- this repo ships with Jest and react-testing-library
- when running `npm run create` you will always get a super basic snaphsot test
- add your own tests to the Component.test.js file
- run your tests via `npm run test-code`
- you can also run a watcher via `npm run test-watch`

### Visual tests

- this repo ships with [react-styleguidist-visual](https://github.com/unindented/react-styleguidist-visual)
- every iteration of the your pattern library will be checked visually against the former version, failing if there are changes
- run your visual tests via `npm run test-visual`
- if the test returns a false positive (e.g. the changes marked are intended), just approve them via `npm run approve`

## Build your components for consuming in other projects

- run `npm run build`

## Deployment

- run `npm run build-styleguide`
- copy the contents of the folder `/styleguide` to the `htdocs`-Directory of your server

## Build the bundles for consuming in other projects

- create .js file inside src/build-files/
- import all components you want your bundle to include
- export them as one object
- change the parameter given to the bundle command inside the package.json to match the filename from step 1
- run `npm run bundle`

## Consume the components in non-react apps

- the .css and .js file created by the bundle command to your legacy app build pipeline or simply insert it inside your HTML
- after the code is loaded mount your components via `_preactComponents.render<YOURCOMPONENTNAME>(props, container, callback)`
- the variable name can be changed inside `./scripts/bundle.js:51:15`

## build styleguide for deployment

- run `npm run build`
