# Patty - React Pattern Library Framework

Get started with your Styleguide with great tools at your hand, utilizing [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist), [react-styleguidist-visual](https://github.com/unindented/react-styleguidist-visual), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)!

Maintained with ‚ù§ by [Eric Zieger](https://github.com/thezieger) and [Sven Bischoff](https://github.com/medienlampe).

## Local development

- clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to spin up the local dev server

## Creating new components

- run `npm run create` (atm. only Linux/Mac)
- follow the instructions shown in the terminal

## Writing tests

### Code tests

- this repo ships with Jest and react-testing-library
- when running `npm run create` you will always get a super basic snaphsot test
- add your own tests to the Component.test.js file
- run your tests via `npm run test-code`
- you can also run a watcher via `npm run test-watch`

### Visual tests

- this repo ships with [react-styleguidist-visual](https://github.com/unindented/react-styleguidist-visual)
- every iteration of the your pattern library will be checked visually against the former version, failing if there are changes
- run your visual tests via `npm run test-visual`
- if the test returns a false positive (e.g. the changes marked are intended), just approve them via `npm run approve`

## Build your components for consuming in other projects

- run `npm run build`

## Deployment

- run `npm run build-styleguide`
- copy the contents of the folder `/styleguide` to the `htdocs`-Directory of your server

## Build the bundles for consuming in other projects

- create bundler index file, where you're importing all components you want your bundle to include and export them as one object - e.g. `src/build-files/somefancyproject.js`:
  ```
  import { renderSomeFancyComponent } from '../SomeFancyComponent/SomeFancyComponent.js';
  import { renderAnotherFancyComponent } from '../AnotherFancyComponent/AnotherFancyComponent.js';
  export { renderSomeFancyComponent, renderAnotherFancyComponent };
  ```
- run the bundler for your project: `npm run bundleLegacy somefancyproject`

## Consume the components in non-react apps

- the .css and .js file created by the bundle command to your legacy app build pipeline or simply insert it inside your HTML
- after the code is loaded mount your components, via `_preactComponents.render<YOURCOMPONENTNAME>(props, container, callback)` e.g.
  ```
  _preactComponents.renderSomeFancyComponent(
    {"foo": "bar"},
    document.getElementById("foo"),
    function(){ console.log("Rendered foo!");
  });
  ```
- the variable name can be changed by editing `library` inside `config.output` in the file `./scripts/bundle.js`
- it is possible to set another namespace instead of `_preactComponents` by running `npm run bundleLegacy somefancyproject anotherNamespace`. It might be interesting if you include more than one of these bundles in your project (otherwise the last one would overwrite the others).

## build styleguide for deployment

- run `npm run build`
